# Project: Landing Page

## Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree

## Content

The project shows a landing page where the navigation menu is dynamically built
with the use of javascript depending on the amount of available sections in the html document.

Each navigation entry is linked with the corresponding section. When clicked, the page automatically
scrolls to the corresponding section.

When a section is at the top of the viewport, the section state changes to active to 
differentiate between the not active states.

The used event listeners are "click" and "scroll".
